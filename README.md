# Strongpass

A deterministic, cryptographically strong, password generator

## Is it safe?

Safe? Probably.

Secure? Probably.

Generally usable? [Perhaps Not](https://tonyarcieri.com/4-fatal-flaws-in-deterministic-password-managers)

Seriously, read that article by [https://github.com/tarcieri](@tarcieri). I built this tool as an experiment and I have found that I really don't use it at all. Tony lays out the usability and security arguments well.
